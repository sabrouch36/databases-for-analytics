# Exercise 04: Advanced SQL, Jupyter, and Visualization

- Name:
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module:
- Database Used: World Database
- Tools Used: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks

---

## Instructions

- Complete each task using the **World database** installed earlier.
- For SQL questions:
  - Write the SQL command in a fenced code block
  - Execute the command and include a **screenshot of the results**
- For Jupyter Notebook questions:
  - Include the required Python statements
  - Include **screenshots of the notebook output**
- Store all screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each question.

## Question 1

Considering the World database, write a SQL statement that will **display the names of countries that speak more than two official languages**, along with the **number of official languages spoken**.

- Sort the results by **number of languages**, from **most to least**.
- *Hint: There are fewer than 10 countries in the results.*

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
  c.name AS country_name,
  COUNT(*) AS official_language_count
FROM country AS c
JOIN countrylanguage AS cl
  ON cl.countrycode = c.code
WHERE cl.isofficial = 'T'
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY official_language_count DESC, country_name;

```
The country table was joined with the countrylanguage table using the country code.
Only official languages were included by filtering isofficial = 'T'.
The results were grouped by country name to count the number of official languages per country.
The HAVING clause was used to keep only countries with more than two official languages.
The results were sorted in descending order based on the number of official languages.

## Question 2

Using **Jupyter Notebooks**, you must use the `create_engine` command to connect to your database.

After the `create_engine` command is executed, **what are the three statements required to execute the query from Question 1 and display the results in the notebook**?

### Python Code

```python
# Your three Python statements here
```sql = """

# SELECT c.name AS country_name,
       COUNT(*) AS official_language_count
FROM country AS c
JOIN countrylanguage AS cl
  ON cl.countrycode = c.code
WHERE cl.isofficial = 'T'
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY official_language_count DESC, country_name;
"""

df = pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)

## Question 3

Using **Jupyter Notebooks**, write the Python code needed to produce the following graph:

![countries.jpg](./instructions/04-countries.jpg)

(The graph shows country-level results derived from the World database.)

### Python Code

```python
# Your Python code here
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

plt.bar(
    df["country_name"],
    df["official_language_count"]
)

plt.xlabel("Country")
plt.ylabel("Number of Official Languages")
plt.title("Countries with Multiple Official Languages")

plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
